	Download from python.org.  (https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2.Install Django: You can install Django using pip.
	pip install django
3.Create a Project Directory: Choose a directory where you want to create your project.




Create a New Django Project
1.Start a New Project: Use the Django command to create a new project.
	django-admin startproject myproject

2.Navigate to Your Project Directory:
	cd myproject

3: Start the Development Server
	python manage.py runserver



Create a Django App
1.Create a New App: An app is a web application that does something
	python manage.py startapp myapp

2. Add the App to Settings: Open myproject/settings.py and add your app to the INSTALLED_APPS list:

	INSTALLED_APPS = [
    				...
    				'myapp',
	]
3.  Create Views
	Edit myapp/views.py: Create a simple view

	from django.http import HttpResponse

	def home(request):
    		return HttpResponse("Hello, Django!")


Set Up URLs

	Create a URL Configuration: In myapp, create a file named urls.py.

	from django.urls import path
	from .views import home

	urlpatterns = [
    			path('', home, name='home'),
	]



	Include Your App's URLs in the Project: Edit myproject/urls.py to include your appâ€™s URLs.
	
	from django.contrib import admin
	from django.urls import path, include

	urlpatterns = [
    		path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
    		path('', include('myapp.urls')),
	]
